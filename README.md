# godot-line3d
Line3D node to be used with Godot

Given an origin and target nodes you can have a 3d line which is a cyllinder mesh under the hood. It's very simple and straightforward, I made for my usage based on what I needed.

### Todo
- It would be nice to keep its origin as its position instead of needing another node for it
